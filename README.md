# packwiz-spec
A format for specifying Minecraft modpacks, designed to be easy to manipulate with tools.

## Where to Start
You probably want to start with the pack format.

## Inspiration
This modpack format is heavily inspired by the manifest format of [Scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop) and by [PackUpdate](https://github.com/XDjackieXD/PackUpdate).

## Development
All the files are generated using `updateAllFiles.js` from the JSON files in the `metadata/` folders and the TOML files in the `examples/` folders.
